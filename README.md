# CyberVT-Sep22-Demo

This is the activity for Tuesday, September 24. Please download the file from the main directory but DO NOT LOOK IN THE FOLDER if you don't want the answer to be spoiled for you. Good luck!

# Instructions to get started

Download the setup script with this command:

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bbaum11/CyberVT-Sep24-Demo/refs/heads/main/SetupScript.sh

If you are using VMWare, you can pase by clicking 'Edit -> Paste' at the top of the window.
If you are using VirtualBox, enable the shared clipboard with 'Machine -> Shared Clipboard' and set it to Bidirectional.

If for some reason the Virtualization software is being weird, you're just going to have to type out the link instead.
